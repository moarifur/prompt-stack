# Getting Started with Inngest

Build reliable background workflows in your Next.js app in just 10 minutes.

---

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you'll be able to:

- ✅ Set up Inngest in your Next.js project
- ✅ Create your first background function
- ✅ Trigger functions from your code and the Dev Server UI

---

## Prerequisites

- Next.js app with App Router
- Node.js installed on your machine

---

## Installation

### Step 1: Start Your Next.js App

First, get your development server running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Keep this terminal running and open a new tab for the next steps.

---

### Step 2: Install Inngest SDK

In a new terminal tab, install the Inngest package:

```bash
npm install inngest
```

---

### Step 3: Start the Inngest Dev Server

The Dev Server gives you a local environment to test and debug your functions:

```bash
npx inngest-cli@latest dev
```

**Expected output:**

```
Inngest Dev Server online at 0.0.0.0:8288
- http://127.0.0.1:8288 (http://localhost:8288)
```

Open **http://localhost:8288** in your browser to access the Dev Server UI.

> 💡 **Tip:** The Dev Server is like a local testing environment where you can see all your events and function runs in real-time.

---

## Configuration

### Step 4: Create the Inngest Client

The client is how you'll send events and define functions.

Create a new directory: `src/inngest/`

**`src/inngest/client.js`**

```javascript
import { Inngest } from "inngest"

// Create a client to send and receive events
export const inngest = new Inngest({ id: "my-app" })
```

---

### Step 5: Set Up the API Route Handler

Inngest needs an endpoint to communicate with your app. Create the route handler:

**`src/app/api/inngest/route.js`**

```javascript
import { serve } from "inngest/next"
import { inngest } from "@/inngest/client"

export const { GET, POST, PUT } = serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [
    // Your functions will be registered here
  ]
})
```

> 📌 **Note:** This route allows Inngest to invoke your functions securely via HTTP.

---

## Creating Your First Function

### Step 6: Define the Function

Functions in Inngest are triggered by events. Let's create a simple "Hello World" function.

**`src/inngest/functions.js`**

```javascript
import { inngest } from "./client"

export const helloWorld = inngest.createFunction(
  { id: "hello-world" },
  { event: "test/hello.world" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
    await step.sleep("wait-a-moment", "1s")
    return { message: `Hello ${event.data.email}!` }
  }
)
```

**What's happening here?**

- `id`: Unique identifier for your function
- `event`: The event name that triggers this function
- `step.sleep()`: Built-in step that pauses execution (great for rate limiting!)
- `event.data`: Access data passed with the event

---

### Step 7: Register the Function

Import and add your function to the route handler:

**`src/app/api/inngest/route.js`**

```javascript
import { serve } from "inngest/next"
import { inngest } from "@/inngest/client"
import { helloWorld } from "@/inngest/functions" // ← Import here

export const { GET, POST, PUT } = serve({
  client: inngest,
  functions: [
    helloWorld, // ← Register here
  ]
})
```

---

## Testing Your Function

### Method 1: Trigger from Dev Server UI

1. Open **http://localhost:8288/functions**
2. Find your `hello-world` function
3. Click the **"Invoke"** button
4. Add this payload in the editor:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "email": "test@example.com"
  }
}
```

5. Click **"Invoke Function"**

You'll see the function run in the **"Runs"** tab with full details: payload, output, and timeline.

> 🎉 **Success!** Your function waited 1 second and returned "Hello test@example.com!"

---

### Method 2: Trigger from Your Code

Let's send events programmatically from your Next.js app.

**`src/app/api/hello/route.js`**

```javascript
import { NextResponse } from "next/server"
import { inngest } from "@/inngest/client"

// Ensure a fresh event is sent on every request
export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"

export async function GET() {
  // Send an event to Inngest
  await inngest.send({
    name: "test/hello.world",
    data: {
      email: "testUser@example.com"
    }
  })

  return NextResponse.json({ message: "Event sent!" })
}
```

**Test it:**

Visit **http://localhost:3000/api/hello** and you'll see:

```json
{ "message": "Event sent!" }
```

Check the Dev Server UI - a new run will appear automatically!

> 💡 **Tip:** In production, you'd typically send events during POST requests (e.g., after a user signup or payment).

---

## Real-World Example

Here's how to trigger your function from a homepage button:

**`src/app/(dashboard)/page.js`**

```javascript
import prisma from '@/lib/db'
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

const HomePage = async () => {
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany()

  return (
    <>
      <h1 className="text-5xl">My Users</h1>
      <br />

      {JSON.stringify(users, null, 2)}

      <a href="/api/hello">
        <Button>Trigger Background Job</Button>
      </a>
    </>
  )
}

export default HomePage
```

When users click the button, it hits `/api/hello`, which sends an event that triggers your `hello-world` function in the background!

---

## Next Steps

🎉 **Congratulations!** You've successfully:

- Set up Inngest in your Next.js app
- Created and registered a function
- Triggered it from both the UI and your code

### What's Next?

- **Add more functions** for different events (user signups, payments, etc.)
- **Use `step.run()`** to break functions into retriable steps
- **Chain functions** together for complex workflows
- **Deploy to production** (functions work the same way!)

---

## Common Use Cases

- 📧 Drip email campaigns
- 💳 Payment processing workflows
- 🤖 Chaining LLM interactions
- 📊 Async data processing
- ⏰ Scheduled tasks

---

## Debugging Tips

The Dev Server UI makes debugging easy:

- **Rerun** any function with the same payload
- **Cancel** long-running functions
- View full **execution timeline** with step-by-step details
- Inspect **event payloads** and **function outputs**
